# Training



# Evaluation
To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

# Pre-trained Models
The logistic regression-based model and the neural network-based model do not contain any pretrained model , i.e. these models are hand-crafted from scartch by myself.

# Results
Our model achieves the following performance:
